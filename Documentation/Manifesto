# **A game where you are hooking up your grandma’s VCR.**

* Why is Grandma’s house a comfortable, homey environment?
    * Nostalgia - you spent time here as a child, grew up here, and it was a welcoming, safe space for you to play
    * It has the comfort and familiarity of home without the baggage of having lived there - it is a break from any stress that home might hold
* What does Grandma represent?
    * A healthy, fulfilling familial relationship
    * Familial responsibility - she took care of you, and now you are taking care of her
* How do you keep a game where you help your aging grandmother with things she can’t do from getting sad or bittersweet?
    * Emphasis on positive emotions - Grandma is happy you’re here to help her out
    * Environment is idealized, not realistic - nothing should suggest limited ability or mobility, time passing being negative; only cute, positive things like doilies
* How do you reflect this atmosphere visually?
    * Light, pastel and bright colors - no room for darkness or negativity
    * Cutesy round models
    * Cultural grandma identifiers - cross stitch, doilies, knitting, etc
* Why a VCR and videotapes?
    * Our generation associates them with our childhoods
    * They’re the type of obsolete technology that lingers with the elderly
    * VHS tapes are associated with home video
    * There are very strong physical actions and feedback associated with this tech - sliding tapes out of their sleeves, inserting a tape into the VCR, etc
* What parts of these physical experiences are integral to the intended experience, and how do you translate them into VR?
    * The haptics of plugging and unplugging cords - magnetic-type snapping
    * The pleasure of clicking buttons - big TV buttons that press and unpress with accompanying feedback
    * Feeding tapes into a VCR - pushing in and then having it be sucked the rest of the way, with sound effects
