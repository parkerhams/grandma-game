# Alpha Build Playtest - 10-4-2019

## Notes from Testers

### Tester 1

* Color-coordinated the cables - first instinct
* Like the feel of the cables snapping in
* Cables are easy to accidentally unplug
* Face goes black when too close to the table
* Movement feels "fine"
* Difficulty reaching down, going low
* Boundary conflicts
* Room size is pretty good, asset size is good
* Want more stuff to do

### Tester 2

* Aestherics are interesting
* Moving around
* Make sure you can see the cables from the starting position
* Room has no ceiling
* Crouching is unfortunate

### Tester 3

* Movement smoothing for sudden stick movement
*"Balloon cords"
* Can't reach the devices from behind the table, facing Grandma
* Cable plugins are misaligned
* Lack of cable prongs is confusing
* Knows that the TV is on, and that it has a blue screen
* Remove the tape that doesn't do anything
* VCR doesn't do anything - buttons inactive
* No good indication that the cables were in the wrong order

### Tester 4

* Emergent interactions with Grandma (pointing, poking, etc)
* Accidental spinning
* "This is really cool!"
* Cables pull apart
* Wire snapping through the desk
* Wire going crazy after you pull it through the desk
* Don't need to use buttons to grab, just the finger hands
* Double fisting wires can get dicey
* Not super disoriented
* Cable physics still a little wonky
* A little easy

### Tester 5

* Make sure to disable the debug menu
* Reduce crouching
* Likes the physics of the wires
* Looks really nice
* Kind of hard to control sometimes
* Head broke off of the yellow wire briefly
* Having a bit of trouble getting the cables to stay plugged in
* Some wires clipping through the table

### Tester 6

* First time in VR
* The wire looks like a bunch of sausages
* Stick to move around and look is kind of disorienting
* Wish there was a couch and more homey furniture
* Feels prison-ish
* Had to explain distance grabbing again
* Trying to figure out what goes where
* Likes the snap into place
* Plugged cables into wall, came out
* Stick movement made tester dizzy
* Wish there were more props

### Tester 7

* First time in VR
* Recommend removing stick movement
* Hooks up RCA cables first
* Asked about whether TV RCA sockets should be colored
* Likes wire physics
* Not close enough to reach back of TV and VCR from behind table
* Movement is disorienting
* Unplugging problems when plugged into itself
* A lot of black cables, not very distinct from each other
