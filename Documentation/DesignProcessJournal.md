### CRT & VCR Prototyping
The core loop of the game focuses closely on player interaction with the CRT TV and VCR devices. This presents an interesting challenge because we're trying to both emulate the behavior of a real-world object but also simplify it for clumsy VR hands.

Our solution to this problem is to maintain the core functionality of the device between reality to the model so that it acts in a predictable and recognizeable manner, while also simplifying the scope and complexity of its actions. 

For example, the model CRT TV still requires power to function, has to be turned on before it can be adjusted, can switch between a number of channels, and otherwise acts the same as a true-to-life CRT TV. However, the scope of its actions is far simplified. The array of buttons available has been cut down to just three: power, channel up, and channel down. Similarly, only three channels are available to flip through. This combination of functional emulation and scope simplification results in a happy medium that can be understood by players with or without preexisting knowledge of how a CRT television functions.

Armed with this goal and an early model for the Television, we prototyped the device's behavioral system as well as its simplified buttons and sockets.
