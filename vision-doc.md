<h1>GRANDMA'S FAVOURITE INDIE</h1>

created in Unity 2019.1.10

This document will outline the core gameplay, features, and purpose of the project "Weekend at Grandma's".

<h2>Synopsis:</h2>

"Weekend at Grandma's" is a Virtual Reality game taking place inside the player's grandmother's sitting room. Grandma isn't very tech savvy, and needs 
help setting up setting up her VCR and TV to watch her VHS tapes. Players will be picking up and connecting cables to the correct slots in order to 
have the correct things appear on screen.

This project will be developed for the Oculus Quest platform. 


<h2>Gameplay:</h2>

Players will be able to to:
* Grab cables with the press of a trigger on the Oculus controllers
* Rotate objects to get better views of ports
* Connect cables to ports and remove them
* Speak with their grandmother
* Watch clips on VHS tapes
* Connect component cables and audio cables
* See progress indicated on television, i.e. TV inpouts, static sounds when cables are connecting, etc.
* Grab and put VHS tapes into the VHS player

This project will be developed over the course of 7 weeks.
**TIMELINE:**
* Week One: Pre-Production and Prototyping with the Oculus Quest
* Week Two: Prototyping with Gameplay interactions
* Week Three: Alpha Build - all key features and interaction functional, no new systems to be added
* Week Four: Continuing refinement and fleshing out of games implemented systems, interactions, etc.
* Week Five: Beta Build - game is playable from start-to-finish with minor bugs and core features fleshed out
* Week Six: Polishing of gameplay features, visuals, and systems
* Week Seven: Golden Master - game poilish is fully implemented and bug tested

**Week 1 Physical Prototyping & Puzzle Design Results: (Cole & Dan)**
* Found that tactility was a large part of the system's appeal
* Established "Cable discovery" as a mechanical alternative to cable complexity
	* Saves programming work, making more broken/weird/non-functioning cables is easier than programming more complex systems
	* Is still fun, picking cables up, evaluating them, then selecting the right ones
	* prone to emergent gameplay such as plugging in the unecessary cables/or arranging them
* Found effective ways to stylize and simplify the physical interaction between people and the CRT / VCR
	* Fewer buttons. We only need Power, Play, and Stop on the VCR and only Power, Channel +/- on the TV
	* Maintains a level of emulation from the real devices, but simplifies the action for big clumsy VR hands
* Simplified the device count down from the CRT/Stereo/VCR model down to just the CRT/VCR
	* Again, less programming load, and a shift away from cable placement as a primary mechanic
